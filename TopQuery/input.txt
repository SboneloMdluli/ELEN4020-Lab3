47 INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS.
48 
49 The Republic of Plato is the longest of his works with the exception
50 of the Laws, and is certainly the greatest of them. There are nearer
51 approaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist; the
52 Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of
53 the State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the
54 Symposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence. But no other
55 Dialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same perfection
56 of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or contains
57 more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not of one age
58 only but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper irony or a greater
59 wealth of humour or imagery, or more dramatic power. Nor in any other of
60 his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and speculation, or
61 to connect politics with philosophy. The Republic is the centre around
62 which the other Dialogues may be grouped; here philosophy reaches the
63 highest point (cp, especially in Books V, VI, VII) to which ancient
64 thinkers ever attained. Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the
65 moderns, was the first who conceived a method of knowledge, although
66 neither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from
67 the substance of truth; and both of them had to be content with an
68 abstraction of science which was not yet realized. He was the greatest
69 metaphysical genius whom the world has seen; and in him, more than in
70 any other ancient thinker, the germs of future knowledge are contained.
71 The sciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many
72 instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon the analyses
73 of Socrates and Plato. The principles of definition, the law of
74 contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction
75 between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion, between means
76 and ends, between causes and conditions; also the division of the mind
77 into the rational, concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of pleasures
78 and desires into necessary and unnecessary--these and other great
79 forms of thought are all of them to be found in the Republic, and were
80 probably first invented by Plato. The greatest of all logical truths,
81 and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight,
82 the difference between words and things, has been most strenuously
83 insisted on by him (cp. Rep.; Polit.; Cratyl. 435, 436 ff), although he
84 has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings (e.g.
85 Rep.). But he does not bind up truth in logical formulae,--logic is
86 still veiled in metaphysics; and the science which he imagines to
87 'contemplate all truth and all existence' is very unlike the doctrine of
88 the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered (Soph. Elenchi,
89 33. 18).
90 
91 Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of a
92 still larger design which was to have included an ideal history of
93 Athens, as well as a political and physical philosophy. The fragment of
94 the Critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in
95 importance to the tale of Troy and the legend of Arthur; and is said as
96 a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth
97 century. This mythical tale, of which the subject was a history of the
98 wars of the Athenians against the Island of Atlantis, is supposed to be
99 founded upon an unfinished poem of Solon, to which it would have stood
100 in the same relation as the writings of the logographers to the poems of
101 Homer. It would have told of a struggle for Liberty (cp. Tim. 25 C), intended
102 to represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas. We may judge from the
103 noble commencement of the Timaeus, from the fragment of the Critias
104 itself, and from the third book of the Laws, in what manner Plato would
105 have treated this high argument. We can only guess why the great design
106 was abandoned; perhaps because Plato became sensible of some incongruity
107 in a fictitious history, or because he had lost his interest in it, or
108 because advancing years forbade the completion of it; and we may please
109 ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative ever been
110 finished, we should have found Plato himself sympathising with the
111 struggle for Hellenic independence (cp. Laws  iii. 698 ff.), singing a
112 hymn of triumph over Marathon and Salamis, perhaps making the reflection
113 of Herodotus (v. 78) where he contemplates the growth of the Athenian
114 empire--'How brave a thing is freedom of speech, which has made the
115 Athenians so far exceed every other state of Hellas in greatness!' or,
116 more probably, attributing the victory to the ancient good order of
117 Athens and to the favor of Apollo and Athene (cp. Introd. to Critias).
118 
119 Again, Plato may be regarded as the 'captain' ('arhchegoz') or leader
120 of a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found the
121 original of Cicero's De Republica, of St. Augustine's City of God,
122 of the Utopia of Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary
123 States which are framed upon the same model. The extent to which
124 Aristotle or the Aristotelian school were indebted to him in the
125 Politics has been little recognised, and the recognition is the
126 more necessary because it is not made by Aristotle himself. The two
127 philosophers had more in common than they were conscious of; and
128 probably some elements of Plato remain still undetected in Aristotle. In
129 English philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in the
130 works of the Cambridge Platonists, but in great original writers like
131 Berkeley or Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas. That there is a truth
132 higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness to herself, is
133 a conviction which in our own generation has been enthusiastically
134 asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. Of the Greek authors who at the
135 Renaissance brought a new life into the world Plato has had the greatest
136 influence. The Republic of Plato is also the first treatise upon
137 education, of which the writings of Milton and Locke, Rousseau, Jean
138 Paul, and Goethe are the legitimate descendants. Like Dante or Bunyan,
139 he has a revelation of another life; like Bacon, he is profoundly
140 impressed with the unity of knowledge; in the early Church he exercised
141 a real influence on theology, and at the Revival of Literature on
142 politics. Even the fragments of his words when 'repeated at second-hand'
143 (Symp. 215 D) have in all ages ravished the hearts of men, who have seen
144 reflected in them their own higher nature. He is the father of idealism
145 in philosophy, in politics, in literature. And many of the latest
146 conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the unity of
147 knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes, have been
148 anticipated in a dream by him.
